 * @brief The LED matrix module implements control for a 5x5 RGB LED matrix
 * 
 * Normal usage is:
 * - LED_Matrix_Init to initialize the LED matrix.
 * - Select the LED to illuminate
 * -- Select_LED to select the row, column, and color of the LED to illuminate
 * - Clear all LEDs
 * -- Clears all the LEDs that are illuminated in order to allow for the next LED to be illuminated

 * This module intiializes the LED matrix by setting the direction all the pins utilized for the RGB LED matrix. All pins utilized are set to the output direction so they can be utilized for general. The Clear_LED function is then called to ensure that all LEDs are initially shut off.
 * This module is specific to the MSP430F5529 as there are no easy ways to have a hardware abstraction layer.
